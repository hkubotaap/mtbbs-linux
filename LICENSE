This software is a modern reimplementation of the original MTBBS (Multi-Tasking
BBS) Ver 3.02 concept and design by Yoshihiro Myokan, using contemporary
technology stack (Python, React, SQLite).

Original MTBBS was a pioneering Japanese BBS system developed in 1997.
MTBBS-Linux honors the original design while bringing it to modern platforms
with enhanced features and web-based administration.
